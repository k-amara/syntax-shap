# SyntaxShap: Syntax-aware SHAP-based Explainability Method for Autoregressive Language Models

This is the code to implement the SyntaxShap method introduce in "Syntax-aware Explainability Method for Text Generation".
SyntaxShap is a local model-agnostic explainability method for autoregressive language models. 
It leverages the syntactic structure of the input to provide more accurate and interpretable explanations. 
SyntaxShap is based on the SHAP framework and uses a novel syntactic-aware sampling method to generate the input perturbations.
It designs word coalitions based on the dependency tree of the input.
